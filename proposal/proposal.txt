Course Checklist Widget
*Description*
The Course Checklist Widget is an interactive checklist to track a student's progression in 
completing a degree plan. It will be similar to the checklists UW's Faculty of Mathematics
offers on their website.
e.g. - https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/programs/require/2013-2014/bcs_bus.html

For the widget, the degree plan we'll be using is the Bachelor of CS - Business Option Plan.

*Interaction*
Users will be able to plan how they will complete their degree by indicating the courses they will
take and which term they plan to take the courses. 

In addition, the checklist will then 
1. indicate whether the prerequisites are met for each course chosen
2. indicate whether each course chosen is available during the term the student plans to take it
3. based on the information given, determine when the student will graduate

*Challenges*
- Challenge #1 - Filling the Checklist and Calculating When the Student Graduates
The data for the courses taken & scheduled by the student and the grades of the student will be 
provided by the CS 349 academic web service -
https://cs349.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca:9410/api/v1/student/stdGrades/USERID .

Parsing this data, our widget will fill the corresponding checkboxes on its checklist.

The widget will then encourage the student to input the courses they plan to take and when
they plan to take them. When all the requirements of the checklist are/will be met, the widget 
can then determine the term when the student graduates by the last study term indicated on 
the checklist.

If the checklist is not completed, a rough estimate of the graduation date can still be calculated.
The widget can divide the number of remaining courses required by the average number of courses 
taken per a study term by the student and ask for how many co-op/off terms the student plans to take.

Graduation Date = current term + 
                            # of courses remaining / # of courses taken per a study term + 
                            # of co-op/off terms

The rough estimate can also be made smarter by suggesting
to the student to take online courses during their co-op/off terms thereby potentially allowing the
student to graduate earlier.

Challenge #2 - Checking Prerequisites
To indicate whether the prerequisites are met for each course chosen,
the widget will retreive the prequisites of the courses chosen from the UW Open Data API web service:
https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation/blob/master/v2/courses/subject_catalog_number_prerequisites.md .
The widget will then check whether the student has met those prerequisites for each course chosen.

- Challenge #3 - Checking Terms Offered
To indicate whether each course chosen is available during the term the student plans to take it,
the widget will retreive the terms offered of the courses chosen from the UW Open Data API web service:
https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation/blob/master/v2/courses/course_id.md .
The widget will then check for each course chosen that the course is offered for the term the student
plans to take it.

- Challenge #4 - Compacting the Checklist to the Size of a Widget
The checklist is quite large so compacting the checklist into the size of a widget without 
compromising aesthetics and usability will be challenging. It will need to be well though out.
